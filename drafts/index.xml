What I found was a well-written exploration of Western architectural history, and a severely disappointing lack of imagination.
De Botton writes eloquently about the various architectural trends and styles that have characterised Western cultures for the last few hundred years. However, when he attempts to make any statement about the role of architecture in our society, and its connection to the land, he displays a real narrowness of thought that seems below him.</description></item><item><title>Some quotes from "The Technological Society" (1954)</title><link>/drafts/some-quotes-from-the-technological-society/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2018 01:28:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>/drafts/some-quotes-from-the-technological-society/</guid><description>Do you remember this scene from Metropolis? It is famous for the explosion that happens shortly the above clip. The young protagonist Freder has a vision of a ravenous machine-god eating ranks of proletariat workers. &amp;ldquo;Moloch!&amp;rdquo; he cries, and faints.
But until the explosion occurs, the machine runs flawlessly. Look at it: its operators
  Technique transforms everything it touches into a machine.

Its image has been tarnished by consumer loyalty programs and the party loyalty of partisan politics. But a hundred years ago, American philosopher Josiah Royce had a unique, hopeful vision of loyalty which defied its poor (even back then) reputation. I was enthralled by his ideas, because they seemed utterly relevant to life today&amp;mdash;both to the big debates of the intelligentsia, and also to the choices myself and my friends are making for ourselves.</description></item><item><title>Loyalty and the Grand Philosophical Exception</title><link>/drafts/the-rehabilitation-of-loyalty/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2017 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/drafts/the-rehabilitation-of-loyalty/</guid><description>The word &amp;ldquo;loyalty&amp;rdquo; makes me think of flimsy punch-cards printed with arrays of takeaway coffees or Subway sandwiches. It reminds me of the soldiers of World War I, naïvely believing in something more than the cynical game of geopolitics. It describes simple-minded faithful canines, and those who toe the party line.
Even a hundred years ago, loyalty had a poor reputation. In 1907, Josiah Royce set out to rehabilitate the idea of loyalty from its unsavoury historical baggage.</description></item><item><title>Loyalty: A Primer For My Friends and Family</title><link>/drafts/loyalty/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 Mar 2017 05:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/drafts/loyalty/</guid><description>Loyalty is a bit of a dirty word. It&amp;rsquo;s been associated with so many unpleasant ideas, actions, and movements that it&amp;rsquo;s hard for us to overcome its nauseating baggage. When loyalty is mentioned, we are more likely to remember the Nuremberg trials than the civil rights movement. We&amp;rsquo;re more likely to imagine lackeys and lickspittles than we are heroes &amp;ndash; and even our images of loyal heroes are likely to be re-examined through lenses that reveal their privilege, supremacy and appropriation.</description></item></channel></rss>
