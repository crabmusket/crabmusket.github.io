They idea that they promote a pure function to do some computation in a monad makes sense, but I&amp;rsquo;ve never found uses for them in my code, and I think it&amp;rsquo;s because I don&amp;rsquo;t fully understand them. That changed yesterday, so I hope that my process will help other people in my position come to terms with liftM.</description></item></channel></rss>
