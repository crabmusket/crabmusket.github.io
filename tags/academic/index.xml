Its operators are doused in scalding steam, and they stagger away, desperately trying to free themselves from clothes melting to their bodies.
&amp;ldquo;Moloch!&amp;rdquo; cries Freder, the film&amp;rsquo;s young protagonist, as he witnesses the devastating industrial accident. Fainting, he imagines the engine transformed into a huge demonic face. Platoons of workers march into its maw and are dashed on pounding wheels and pistons within.</description></item><item><title>Some quotes from "The Technological Society" (1954)</title><link>/drafts/some-quotes-from-the-technological-society/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 May 2018 01:28:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>/drafts/some-quotes-from-the-technological-society/</guid><description>Do you remember this scene from Metropolis? It is famous for the explosion that happens shortly the above clip. The young protagonist Freder has a vision of a ravenous machine-god eating ranks of proletariat workers. &amp;ldquo;Moloch!&amp;rdquo; he cries, and faints.
But until the explosion occurs, the machine runs flawlessly. Look at it: its operators
Technique transforms everything it touches into a machine.
