It&amp;rsquo;s been associated with so many unpleasant ideas, actions, and movements that it&amp;rsquo;s hard for us to overcome its nauseating baggage. When loyalty is mentioned, we are more likely to remember the Nuremberg trials than the civil rights movement. We&amp;rsquo;re more likely to imagine lackeys and lickspittles than we are heroes &amp;ndash; and even our images of loyal heroes are likely to be re-examined through lenses that reveal their privilege, supremacy and appropriation.</description></item></channel></rss>
